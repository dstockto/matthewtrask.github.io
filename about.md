#About Me

I'm an open source PHP Developer who loves developing around different domains. I love crafting API's and writing unit tests. I think CI is one of the best things in the world, and would love to work on my ops skills. I am always open to a new challenge and look for new ways to solve problems. 

Outside of programming I love new craft beers and riding my bike around Atlanta, especially the Beltline. You can find me in any number of coffee shops around town. Mainly Dancing Goats, cause the patio is nice and I like to read books in their comfy chairs. 

You can find me online at:
