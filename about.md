	##Hi, Im Matt.
	I live in Atlanta, track down awesome new beers, and code a lot.
	I have an affinity for groups that are trying to help the less fortunate in anyway.
	I have contirbuted to Code for Atlanta, Code for Nashville, and Code for Hawaii.
	Outside of that, I am a memeber of AtlantaPHP and getting into Atlanta Javascript.
