#About Me

I'm a web developer with a passion for learning. I don't stop learning. From the hour I take at work daily to learn, to what I do at home; I try not to let a day go without a chapter read. Everyone needs a break, but to fuel the fire in me, I keep turing the pages. Learning how to leverage Javascript in a better way, how to build secure PHP applications, or what non-profit group needs help is what wakes me up in the morning.

#A Few More Things


As I've been talking to more and more people on IRC, Twitter, and actual life, here is a few places you will always find me.

* Twitter: @matthewtrask
* IRC: matthewtrask | Rooms: #phpmentoring, #coderabbi, #phpc, #jquery
* AtlantaPHP User Group
* Code for Atlanta
* I will be at ConnectJS this year in Atlanta, and Nodevember in Nashville.
* /r/webdev, /r/php, /r/phphelp, /r/atlanta

To keep up with everything going on, I read the following blogs:

* [benramsey.com](https://benramsey.com)
* [coderabbi.com](https://coderabbi.github.io/)
* [scotch.io](scotch.io)
* [scaleyourcode.com](https://scaleyourcode.com/)
* [codinghorror.com](codinghorror.com)

Podcasts that I listen too:

* [phpTownHall](phptownhall.com)
* [/dev/hell](http://devhell.info/)
* [Voices of the Elephpant](https://voicesoftheelephpant.com/)
* [nocapes](https://nocapes.net)
* [revolutions](revolutionspodcast.com) Honestly, this is captivating. Mike Duncan planned on spending 12 to 15 episodes on 6 revolutions, and its turned into an in depth look at the French Revolutions. Never knew how complicated that one was.
* [the History of Rome](historyofrome.typepad.com) 78 hours of the history of Rome. Its bloody, its messy and its amazing to know the history of one of the greatest Empires in the world.
