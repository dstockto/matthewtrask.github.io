##I'm Matt.

Im a developer living in Atlanta, chasing down awesome food and beer, coding till the
night is late. I started with HTML and CSS and worked my way up to PHP, MySQL, Bash,
Javascript and Linux. Outside of that I follow politics, music, and Im a big fan of
Walt Disney World. Even though I'm an adult, the magic has never worn out.

Im passionate about learning, helping non-profits build up their online presence, and
helping others get to a position in coding where they are confident in their skills.
