I just got back home from another fantastic [SunshinePHP](https://sunshinephp.com) and as I looked around and talked to others I had a mini-revelation: as the older leaders of our community, the PHP Community, step back and go up the career leader, we need to groom up and coming developers to step into those shoes in our community to keep it going. Lets share some thoughts and see what we can do to help others. 


## Get better at thanking organizers 

It is no secret that organizing a user group, conference, both or more is a thankless job. While you get the occasional thanks via Twitter, in person, or email it could be better. Some user groups have a speakers waitlist while others struggle to get a speaker; let alone line up multiple. 

> If you are a speaker, try and be open to video/remote options.
