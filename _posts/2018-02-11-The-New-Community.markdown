I just got back home from another fantastic [SunshinePHP](https://sunshinephp.com) and as I looked around and talked to others I had a mini-revelation: as the older leaders of our community, the PHP Community, step back and go up the career leader, we need to groom up and coming developers to step into those shoes in our community to keep it going. Lets share some thoughts and see what we can do to help others. 


## Get better at thanking organizers 

It is no secret that organizing a user group, conference, both or more is a thankless job. While you get the occasional thanks via Twitter, in person, or email it could be better. Some user groups have a speakers waitlist while others struggle to get a speaker; let alone line up multiple. 

> If you are a speaker, try and be open to video/remote options. 

It's not the best option... the best option is in person. But as a speaker doing remote video hangouts helps you as much as it helps us. As an organizer I will do whatever I can to help you out including making a [Joind.in](https://joind.in) event for the hangout for the event so you get the speaker cred you are trying to build. 

> Organizers: build a joind.in profile for your user group, and encourage speaker feedback! It's not fair to have a speaker do all the presentation and not get the credit they need for conferences. 

Encourage your members to leave feedback. Hold a raffle at the end of the year for a nice prize, offer a bar tab. Obviously don't go overboard and make yourself broke, but maybe do a pooling, everyone put in $5 a meeting and at the end of the year the most feedback gets it. It only helps everyone and it is silly to not help the speakers in that regard. 

> Thanking a user group organizer can be as simple as getting your company to sponsor pizza for a meeting

One of the biggest reliefs an organizer can feel is knowing that food is taken care of. Food is not a requirement to the meetup, but since the meetup is usually in the evening and requires most people to go from work right to the meetup, its a nice gesture to have some pizza or somethint available. At NashvillePHP, we offer some food (generally not pizza) and beer, which is a choice we have made but definitely requires a conversation among the group.

But trying to wrangle sponsors is no easy feat. There seems to be a disconnect in the world where companies can't seem to see why it is important to sponsor a group till the very last minute.. when their dev team is desparate for people. Let's change that conversation!

> Even if your company can cover half the pizza (lets say $100 a month), that is more money then what we start with. Believe me, we can be frugal and make $100 work for us. But its on you to go to the company and sell the benefits. 

Organizers should be willing to trade a few minutes before the meeting starts to let a sposnor say some words. At conferences, sponsors get booths and some get to speak, why can't we afford them the same thing? Use Twitter as well, its a powerful tool for marketing and make sure if a company is giving your group money you thank them and provide the username of the account for members to thank as well. 

## Get better at being inclusive
