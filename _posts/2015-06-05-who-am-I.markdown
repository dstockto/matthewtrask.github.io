#I'm Matt.
I am a number of things. Im a PHP Developer, open source advocate, mentor,
teacher, community member for PHP and web development, musician, advocate for
open government and now a blogger.

Cal Evans ([@calevans](https://twitter.com/calevans)) and Yitzchok Wilroth ([@coderabbi](https://twitter.com/coderabbi)) both advocate that being a
developer shouldn't stop at 5pm. Rather, you are apart of a growing community of people who will push for improvement in a number of ways. Being on Twitter, Github, blogging, attending conferences and mentoring at a number of ways to get involved.
So here I am, taking another step forward and getting more involved with the PHP
community at large. Im excited to do that.
