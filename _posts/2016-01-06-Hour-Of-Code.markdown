## Give an hour of your time.

I gave two hours, plus the time to drive to and back. What I got in return was well worth it. Its shiny, it tells the time, this watch is rad. Kidding of course. Although I did arrange to pick up an Apple Watch in that area. But what I am really talking about is Hour of Code! Its an initiative by [code.org](https://code.org) to introduce coding to students at an early age and hopefully inspire them to learn some.

I had seen links for Hour of Code floating around on twitter, and decided this year I would take action and participate. I love mentoring, I love helping out, so why not? Well, its definitely an interesting experience!

## How much money do you make?

Within a few days of signing up, a teacher emailed me, and asked if I could come to her classroom and help out. After running it by the boss people at the office, it was a go. A few weeks go by and then as the week arrives, I learn that the main teacher of the class is going to be out. While I wasn;t too nervous, it wasn't exactly inducing calmness in me. Besides being a bearded dude at a middle school, what was I actually doing? Was I supposed to show the students some code, was I supposed to live code, or was it more of a talk?

I invited my friend, Krista, to join me. As a substitute teacher, she was invaluable in keeping the kids on point. So when we got there and checked in, the substitute teacher came out and talked to us quickly. She asked what I wanted to do. Well, at this point, I wanted a beer, but I said we could answer some questions. Sure enough, the kids had a ton of questions, a lot of which they weren't shy about.

* How much money do I make?
* Do I like my job?
* Am I a hacker?
* Is it live TV?
* What is the coolest thing you've done with code?
* Can I do it?
* Is it free?
* Will I make a lot of money?

As you can see, those kids have their priorities straight. I think, looking back, what really helped was making a fast connection to Minecraft. Now, Ive never really played Minecraft, but I know its the cool thing to do as a kid these days. All I hear about is Minecraft this and that. Of course, its a computer program, so to make a connection to the kids, I immediately talked about how Minecraft came to be, and how Microsoft bought it for something like $1 Billion. This set off lights. The students were instantly perked up. "You mean I can make money, and play Minecraft?", yes you can.

## Lets live edit a page.

When the older students came in, I decided to give them something cool to enjoy. Aside from the questions, mostly repeats of the younger kids, they asked me if I could hack. Well, in the most non-political ways possible, I gave them an idea of what a hacker is. Obviously the evil hacker who takes digital information, but there is also good hacking like when a government censors information. That aside, they had great questions, and I was happy to answer them. The fun came when I ssh'd into a Digital Ocean server I had running and essentially added a heading tag and some text on the fly. I have never seen faces brighten up so fast like theirs did. Of course, seeing the terminal, they legitimately thought I was a hacker.

## Code.org

After "hacking" my own website for a few minutes, the students then hoped on to their own computers and did some code.org exercises. They could pick the theme such as Minecraft, Star Wars or some other ones and using Scratch, write very basic code. One thing I kept trying to point out is looking at the code, so they could recognize what code looked like. Some where able to clearly walk me through the code and show me what they did.

## Thoughts

All in all, this was an amazing and powerful experience. I would highly recommend this to any developer I know. Even if you arent a teacher or mentor, give it a try. It will really give you a new perspective on coding and who some of the bright thinkers of tomorrow will be!
