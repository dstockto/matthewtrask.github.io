<p class="intro">This is my first blog post, and I hope its a good one. I'm writing this for a few reasons.</p><br />




## Reasons
* Get more involved with the community
* Help beginners
* Allow me to learn more topics

I called this post "Hello World", because as a programmer learning a new language, its generally considered a good
benchmark to have your code return "Hello World".

{% highlight php %}
<?php echo "Hello World!";?>
{% endhighlight %}

#But who is this?
Im Matt, Im a self taught PHP Developer. Im a supporter of open source software,
as well as working to make the government more open. I contribute to groups like
Code for Atlanta, Code for Nashville and Code for Hawaii. I do what I can to stay
involved with projects that will make me a better developer, and I love turning
around and helping new developers come up and become better developers themselves.

Outside of PHP, I love the craft beer scene in Atlanta. Ever since I was a bartender
at Taco Mac, I was hooked on awesome beers. Im a Red Sox fan, but not a bandwagon fan.
My family is from Boston, so I was taught/endoctrinated early on. Chelsea is my
football/soccer team and I do too much fantasy football to really cheer for a team.

So thats me. Theres a lot more abut me, but thats a good overview. Im sure new posts
will come that will show off more things like my tech stack, what I am working on,
and what I hope to learn soon.
