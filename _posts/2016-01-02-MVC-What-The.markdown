# Lets talk MVC.

So one of my resolutions is to blog more. Why not right? Its a great way to grasp concepts. I dont want to write something and seem like a complete fool, so I do my research, which in turn lets me learn more.

As some of y'all know, I help run a local chapter of Free Code Camp. If you havent heard of Free Code Camp, or FCC; its a way to get people to code for free. It covers the MEAN Stack, ya know Mongo DB, Node Js, Angular JS and Express JS. Thats a lot of Javascript. Even the database is Javascript/JSON based. Opinions aside, its a cool initiative to get people coding. They aim to get you real world experience through helping non-profits with some coding issues. Rad right? Pretty much yes. Well, as I'm one of the moderators and more senior programmers in the group, I help answer questions. One I get a lot is MVC frameworks, when to use them, why are they use etc.

Its funny though, because while I field these questions; certain angry yet brilliant German developers are teaching me how to let go of the MVC. However, its not something that is easily let go. I understand the flaws of it, and I understand the uses. So lets talk about that.

## Some Examples of MVC in the Wild.

The first thing we should look at is some examples. Everyone loves a good example, and there are a lot to look at.

* [Laravel](https://laravel.com)
* [Symfony](https://symfony.com)
* [Zend Framework 2](http://framework.zend.com)
* [CakePHP](http://cakephp.org)

Outside of the PHP community we have

* [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org)
* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com)

The list goes on. There are hybrids even. EmberJs, AngularJs, BackboneJs, and others are MV* types of frameworks. Mainly they are built on the Model-View layer, using both as a hybrid controller situation. Not a bad idea to use them, and combined with a more powerful back end framework, you can build some really powerful web apps with them.
