## You might be a hobbit if...

Once upon a time, I was called a hobbit. Well, not a hobbit per se, but I was told in no uncertain terms my place was in the shire. Dont get me wrong, there is some cool shit that goes on in the shire Im sure. Adventures to Mordor (Lets not talk about how they could have used Eagles and saved us a few hours), dragon fireworks, drinking, tons of food. Freaking paradise right? Well, it wasnt that nice, but after that incident and subsequent blog post I noticed it put in to motion a whole list of things that helped boost my career. But, in reality, the only thing Ive learned is that Im more like an ewok rather then a hobbit.
