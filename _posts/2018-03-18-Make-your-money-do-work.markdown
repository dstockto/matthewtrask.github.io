The biggest lesson I missed when I was younger was how to make more money. I don't mean that in the sense of jumping jobs every two years
or anything like that. I mean in an investment sense. Unfortuantely, I was never really told what an IRA was, just that I needed one. 401k, 
REIT, Financial Independence and so much more was never talked about. Not in schools, home, or anywhere else I could access. Sure I could
have gone online but back then it was more about getting online to get music off Napster or something. Thanks in part to Reddit (ya, Ive heard its 
a shithole, but if you contain it, its not terrible) I stumbled on to the personal finance subreddit, and like dominos I was in both the financial independence and
learn financial independence/retire early section and have just had an awaken. Hopefully this knowledge helps others now.
