 At least once, if not more, you will run into a time where the leader of your team leaves and you have to pick up the pieces. 

## Did you get hit by a bus?

A common expression with programming, and specialized teams within an office, is the famous/infamous "Hit by the Bus" document. Now, its not meant to sound morbid. Nor is it supposed to bear ill will towards someone, it is supposed to be how a team can pick up the pieces when the unexpected happens. The name comes from the fact that no one plans on getting hit by a bus, so it is a document for the unexpected. And it can help you weather multiple scenarios: Team Lead taking a new position and being asked to leave immediately, Team Lead needing to take extended leave of absence that may or may not leave them without internet for extended periods of times, or quite literally the lead is hit by a bus. Lets take a look at what should be on this document so you can survive the first few days.
