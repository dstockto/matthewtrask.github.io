What does a developer do when they become funemployed, even if it was intentional and ending soon? Starting a side project seems to be what I do
during these times. I started one that has so far gained some traction. Lets look into what it is, why I'm doing it and what I hope it will become. 

# AdviseMyResume

This started with a tweet from [David Stanely](https://twitter.com/davidstanely01), in which he was retweeting [Stephanie Hulbert's](https://twitter.com/sehurlburt) request for junior developes and the like
to tweet their resumes and she would retweet them for a greater reach, and through David I saw them. Some were requesting help for their resume because they were not
hearing anything back. I thought this was both brilliant, but limiting. Why? Well, if someone looks at the resume but doesn't retweet it, you lose out. If someone is busy and wants to come back, 
you lose out with Twitters shit search. I thought there was a better way, so I started to build it. A few weeks later, [advisemyresu.me](https://advisemyresu.me) was (mostly) built. With some help from David, we 
scaled up a Laravel and Vue application, deployed through Forge and hosted on [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/54c862a4a5b2) (ref link).

### The Idea  

The idea is this: upload your resume and get feedback on it. Senior Developers, Team Leads, Community Leaders, Hiring Managers and more will come around and help out giving feedback and getting people who submitted their resume
some help. Eventually we plan to expand to a few ideas on the back burner but right now we want to keep the idea small and limited for ease of us. The process works like this:

* You sign up
* Upload your resume
* Tweet out the shortened link we provide (we tweet it too)
* Get feedback
 
 Judging by the twitter stats, there is considerable interest so I am hoping this takes off!
 
 If you are interested in helping out, the project is open sourced on [github](https://github.com/matthewtrask/developerresumes).
 
 Cheers!
