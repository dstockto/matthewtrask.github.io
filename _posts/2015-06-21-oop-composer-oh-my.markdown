When you get into coding and development, everything seems so foreign. OOP, MVC,
MVVM, MV*, JSON, API, and XML. Let alone when a new person sees Angular, Node,
Laravel, Django, Rails or Sass. So what is it all, and how can someone who is new
to the game make sense of this all? Lets start from the ground up.

#Starting out

One big question friends have asked me is where to start? Theres tons of places online
that will help you start learning how to write code. I started on Codecademy, and
its a good starting point. But will you code the next AirBnB? No, you will not. Will
you be able to build something? Absolutely. Its all about what you do *outside* of
the Codecademy.com cirriculm. Thats the key! And its amazing how many people have
yet to figure this out. Ive seen people go to /r/learnprogramming or /r/webdev and say
that Codecademy.com isnt working for them. They say that teamtreehouse.com was great to
start, but now they are stuck. But why are they stuck? Is it cause the videos do not
go very deep into web development? Or is it that people arent being creative enough
with that they have learned over the course of a video series. In the time I have spent
working in this industry, that has been the biggest issue coming around. Not pushing deep
enough while learning.

#After Codecademy

So you've done some work with Codecademy, and you think you can build a page, that's great!
But what now?
