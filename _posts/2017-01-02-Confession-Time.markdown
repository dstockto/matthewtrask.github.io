## *clears throat* Hi, Im new here. Im Matt and I  use Laravel. (Or anything else).

So today, a federal holiday here in America where we enjoy what is possibly labelled the worst hang over in 2017 by some people, or if you are me today you are nursing bruises from fighting with your bike as to what direction we want to go.
However, as many people saw on Twitter, a "discussion" erupted over the architecture of a certain framework. I wont give it away but it starts with "L" and ends with "aravel". Scrolling through the tweets it got noticably hostile because 140 characters is too little a space to have a fruitful and engaged conversation. Also, people in the conversation can not discern between sarcasm or anything else. Now, this isnt just about Laravel, but its been the latest in the discussion.

## The community fractures everytime this happens

Ever since I started with PHP, I have always noticed a divide in the community. If you are a Wordpress developer, then you are ostracized out. If you use Drupal, then you are just a little bit less then "true" PHP developers. And its bullshit. Look, Ill be the first to say I dont like Wordpress or Drupal. A lot of people don't. There are people who do not like Laravel, or CakePHP (Ive ranted against this one), or Joomla!. All this does is make our community weak. There are reasons people use these tools. At first its to get used to the latest or greatest, or a tool that has been around since forever. People float between tools and people will use what gets the job done fastest. You know why? Shipped code is better then perfect code.

Shipped code makes money. Shipped code can convert visitors to a site and convert them to paying users. Shipped code can help change the world. Perfect code sits on your github repo, or local machine all day being refactored to the point of no return. If a dev can spin up an instance of Laravel and push out a site then why should anyone else care? If you are a developer who makes money by contracting out and fixing legacy apps, you should want developers pushing shipped code all day long. It just increases your chance of a phone call. Maybe not today, maybe not this year, but it will happen.

So it comes back to the point, who cares? When these types of arguments pop up on twitter, it only strengthens the divide of the community. And the community is already so fractured that it doesnt need anymore fracturing. We as a community barely survived the debate of the CoC, and its a known fact that certain developers feel left out and hide in their own silos. 

## Criticism can help

If you want to lobby criticism to the developers of the tool you do not like, open a PR, submit some code, get invovled. If you are a developer who developed a tool, be prepared for people to have critiques and handle them in a way that makes users of the tools proud to use your stuff. To lambast someone on twitter is what I consider a low. With a 140 character limit, responses are limited, conversation stymed and at the end of the day everyone loses.
