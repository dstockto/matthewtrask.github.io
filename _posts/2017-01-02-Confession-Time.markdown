## *clears throat* Hi, Im new here. Im Matt and I  use Laravel. (Or anything else).

So today, a federal holiday here in America where we enjoy what is possibly labelled the worst hang over in 2017 by some people, or if you are me today you are nursing bruises from fighting with your bike as to what direction we want to go.
However, as many people saw on Twitter, a "discussion" erupted over the architecture of a certain framework. I wont give it away but it starts with "L" and ends with "aravel". Scrolling through the tweets it got noticably hostile because 140 characters is too 
little a space to have a fruitful and engaged conversation. Also, people in the conversation can not discern between sarcasm or anything else. Now, this isnt just about Laravel, but its been the latest in the discussion.
