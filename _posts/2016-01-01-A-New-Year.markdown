 # It's the New Year. 
 
 Hello 2016. Goodbye 2015. 
 
 Its been quite a fun time. Quite an interesting year to say the least. It was filled with ups and downs, but by far the best year on record I would like to think.
 
 Some of the pluses of 2015:
 * Really dived deep into PHP
 * Became a community member of PHP
 * Gave 2 mini talks at [AtlantaPHP](https://atlantaphp.org)
 * Became a co-organizer of AtlantaPHP
 * Got to go to Hawaii for a week
 * Got an awesome job with great potential
 * Contributed to open source projects
 * Joined an open source team to help maintain [Phergie](http://phergie.org) -- I am going to be a lot better about this in 2016
 * Grew a pretty awesome beard. 
 * Hung out with awesome people. 
 * Became friends with even more awesome people. 
 
 This year was tough. It was a struggle at times. But it is over and all I can do is look forward to the future, which is now. 
 
 ## 2016 Goals
 
 Ive laid out some awesome goals for this year. They revolve around both coding and non-coding. 
 
 They include:
 - Reading a book every week. 
 - Running 6 5k's this year.
 - Code more. 
 - More meaningful commits.
 - Contribute to more open source.
 - Blog more.
 - Speak at a conference.
 
 Outside of that list, its mostly going to be more thoughful, more logical. Push myself to new limits, and make sure I leave an impression on at least one person!
 
 Here is to an awesome 2016!
