#Conference Time!

A few weekends ago, I finally made it. No, not to being 6'4 and beautiful, but to a conference. Its been on my list of things to do for about a year now with some near misses. After I tossed the idea to the boss people at work, we got it all worked out. After getting the hotel and flight set, I was on my way. Hopefully after this, you have more proof why a conference is worth the price. 

##Why SunshinePHP?

The first question to answer, is why [SunshinePHP](http://2016.sunshinephp.com)? Coworkers are leaving this week for [ConFoo](https://confoo.ca), and there are other conferences, but why did I pick Sunshine? A few reasons, first is I opened my mouth and said Id be there, thus causing people I interact with online daily to be excited to finally get to put a face to my online personality. Also, Sunshine is great because its one of the more inexpensive conferences. Price doesnt dictate if a conference is going to be good or not, but with Sunshine being on the lower end of the price scale, it made sense. 

The talks too were curated towards things I was interested in learning. Looking at Confoo, it has great talks. However, Sunshine is specifically PHP, which allows me to get the most of a conference. This isnt to say that language agnostic conferences are less then specific languages! Confoo looks awesome, and I truly wish I was going as well. But since I had to pick, I did what I thought was best for me. I strongly advise you to look at any confereneces that pop up and attend as many as you can!

##The First Day

After I woke up at the crack of dawn, eating breakfast (and drinking) at the airport, I landed in sunny Miami around 12. After spending some time on South Beach, we got back in time for the hotel happy hour. It started out great, and I was able to start meeting some awesome people. After the happy hour ended, a group of us decided to go to dinner. At dinner, we had [Luke Stokes](https://twitter.com/lukestokes), [Jaques Woodcock](https://twitter.com/jwoodcock), [Robert McFrazier](https://twitter.com/rmcfrazier), [Emily Stamey](https://twitter.com/elstamey), and so many more awesome people! After dinner, we were lucky enough to get to hang out more talking over all kinds of topics in Jaques' room with a few bottles of rum and scotch.
