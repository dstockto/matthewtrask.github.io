#Conference Time!

A few weekends ago, I finally made it. No, not to being 6'4 and beautiful, but to a conference. Its been on my list of things to do for about a year now with some near misses. After I tossed the idea to the boss people at work, we got it all worked out. After getting the hotel and flight set, I was on my way. Hopefully after this, you have more proof why a conference is worth the price. 

##Why SunshinePHP?

The first question to answer, is why [SunshinePHP](https://2016.sunshinephp.com)? Coworkers are leaving this week for [ConFoo](https://confoo.ca)
